[UN]ified [ST]ud[E]nt [P]ortal is one-stop shop for students to acquire all needed information, on all platforms and with any* device. From curriculum and timetables to course materials, assigned homework, due-dates, upcoming events and everything else.  

This project is brought to life as part of my **final college project** and I envision this _README_ to contain many notes, code snippets, thoughts, decisions and so on to base **my dissertation on**. Since this is a educational project, I'll always try to keep couple of issues open with `help wanted` tag of  various difficulty levels, to encourage fellow companions to jump into world of open source development with a warm welcome : )  

**DISCLAIMER:**   
This is a side project as a way to explore new stacks, deployment approaches and is not bound to any pragmatic concerns. It is over-engineered specifically for a reason so that I could learn from mistakes of over-engineering, and to identify what actually worked or didn't work!
