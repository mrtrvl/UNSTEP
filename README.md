# UNSTEP

[UN]ified [ST]ud[E]nt [P]ortal is one-stop shop for students to acquire all needed information, on all platforms and with any* device. From curriculum and timetables to course materials, assigned homework, due-dates, upcoming events and everything else.  

This project is brought to life as part of my **final college project** and I envision this _README_ to contain many notes, code snippets, thoughts, decisions and so on to base **my dissertation on**. Since this is a educational project, I'll always try to keep couple of issues open with `help wanted` tag of  various difficulty levels, to encourage fellow companions to jump into world of open source development with a warm welcome : )  

**DISCLAIMER:**   
This is a side project as a way to explore new stacks, deployment approaches and is not bound to any pragmatic concerns. It is over-engineered specifically for a reason so that I could learn from mistakes of over-engineering, and to identify what actually worked or didn't work! Let's [shave that Yak](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html)

## DDD (Domain Driven Design)
> The goal of domain-driven design is to create better software by focusing on a model of the domain rather than the technology.
>
> -- <cite>Eric Evans</cite>

> Use DDD to model a complex domain in the simplest possible way. Never use DDD to make your solution more complex. DDD gives you both the strategic and tactical modeling tools necessary to design high-quality software that meets core business objectives.
>
> -- <cite>Vaughn Vernon</cite>

While the aim of this project is to be one-stop shop for students, it is not necessarily meant to be used by students alone. In order to provide that quality information and functionality to the students, the school personel needs to be onboard as-well. One of the most immediate concerns is actually planning the schedule, which by the time of this writing, is mainly done in Excel. While adding the necessary resources to the system seems quite trivial, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) like operation, creating and planning a schedule is itself much more complex with various business rules. That's where I imagine the DDD would really kick in!


### Ubiquitous Language
> The Ubiquitous Language is a shared language developed by the teamâ€”a team composed of both domain experts and software developers.
>
> -- <cite>Vaughn Vernon</cite>

**Schedule** - A period of time which contains list of items   
**Course** - Degree or diploma program  
**Subject** - One unit of study which one can enroll as part of the course  
**Lecture** - One unit of study which is part of the subject

### Bounded Context
>A Bounded Context gives the team a modeling boundary in which to create a solution to a specific business problem domain. Inside a single Bounded Context is a Ubiquitous Language formulated by the team. It is spoken among the team and in the software model. Disparate teams, sometimes each responsible for a given Bounded Context, use Context Maps to strategically segregate Bounded Contexts and understand their integrations.

.NET Core 2.0  
Visual Studio 2017  
xUnit

## Coding practices and learnings I aspire to follow
- Use properties instead of fields: [Link][properties-vs-public-variables] 
- Comments should tell **why** something is being done. The code already tells what is being done. Comment the code with a higher-level view of what the code aims to ultimately achieve, with pre- and post- conditions. You need to comment on (say) peculiar implementations or checks that are necessary yet counter-intuitive, and possibly reference specification documents etc
- Domain model is blissfully unaware how data is requested or how it is stored in underlaying datastore. 

### Create consistent objects 
Each and every object should start off in a complete and consistent state! 
- Define one factory function per class  
- Have no discrete parameters (no enums, booleans etc)

> "If you have an object, then it's fine" - Zoran Horvat
```csharp

private bool HasDegree { get; } // have no flags

private Teacher(bool hasDegree) 
{
   this.HasDegree = degree;
}

// If you have more than one factory function then this class is probably doing too much
public static Teacher Create() =>
    new Teacher(false);

public static Teacher CreateWithDegree() =>
    new Teacher(true);

public void CalculateSalary() 
{
    if (hasDegree) // this changes execution flow, but it is not immediately clear for the caller
    {
        // Pay more
    }
    else 
    {
        // Pay less
    }
}
```

### Avoid primitive types
Enumerations are root of all evil, because they must be guarded and is just a bomb waiting to blow up. Use a classes* with necessary factory functions instead.

\* Some edge cases: 
* Serialization requires primitive types. 
* ORM's, because they support enums natively and plain integers will be stored in database instead.

> Use enums only when situation requires, not because it is easy thing to do. 

```csharp
enum Day // just a syntatic shugar over :int
{
    Monday, // defaults to 0 if not specified explicitly
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday
    ...
}

public void DoSomething(Day day) // enum assignement verification is not done
{
    if (Enum.IsDefined(typeof(Day), day))
    {
        // do something
    }
    else 
    {
        // do something else????
    }
}
```

### CQRS - Command-Query Segregation Principle
Method should either modify state, or return a value, but not both!

```csharp
public void DoSomething() 
{
    // modifies state, no returning result alloved
}
```
```csharp
public IResult GetResult() 
{
    // no changes to the state allowed. Only get the result. 
}
```

Command (Model):  
   * Modifies the system state
   * Applies all the rules
   * Performs all the validations

Query (View Model):
   * Do not modify any system state
   * No rule checking 

### Exceptions
Exceptions should be used only in exceptional cases. If there is a way to recover from, or expect an exception, then it is not really an exceptional case.

>"Only catch an exception you can handle and avoid rethrowing the same exception. Caller might forget to catch an exception, but it is highly unlikely for a caller to forget to **use the returned object** it asked for" - Zoran Horvat  

Return type of a method should grasp both positive and negative outcomes.

#### Either
Either type comes from functional languages which contains two components, one indicating success, other failure. Consumer doesn't know what Either type will contain, but it must provide strategy for both scenarios either way. 

This goes over my head at the moment of writing, but I'll include this in the code with every intention to find a suitable place to see this through in the practice. 

Anyway, thanks for Zoran Horvat from Pluralsight (course)[advanced-defensive-programming-techniques] to blow my mind.. 

```csharp
Uri address = new Uri("https://something.out.there");
Either<Failed, Resource> result = Fetch(address);

string report = result
     .MapLeft(failure => $"Error fetching the resource - {failure}")
     .Reduce(resource => resource.Data);

Console.WriteLine(report);

```
